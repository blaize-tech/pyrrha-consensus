 * @dev # Worker Node Smart Contract
 *
 * Worker node contract accumulates funds/payments for performed cognitive work and contains inalienable reputation.
 * Note: In Pyrrha there is no mining. In the following versions all mined coins will be also assigned to the
 * `WorkerNode` contract
 *
 * Worker node acts as a state machine and each its function can be evoked only in some certain states. That"s
 * why each function must have state machine-controlled function modifiers. Contract state is managed by
 * - Worker node code (second level of consensus)
 * - Main Pandora contract [Pandora.sol]
 * - Worker node contract itself
